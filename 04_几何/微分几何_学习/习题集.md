# Exercise 7
5. (10 points) Assume that the osculating plane of a line of curvature C ⊂ S , which is nowhere tangent to an asymptotic direction, makes a constant angle with the tangent plane of S along C. Prove that C is a plane curve.
- Osculating plane 密切面
- 定义：过空间曲线上P点的切线和P点的邻近一点Q可作一平面 $\sigma$, 当Q点沿着曲线逼近于P时, 平面 $\sigma$ 的极限位置称为曲线在P点的密切平面。
