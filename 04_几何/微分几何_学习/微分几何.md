# Differential Geometry

There are two aspects of differential geometry of curves and surfaces (absolutely not curves and surfaces). One is called classical differential geometry, of which the subject could be roughly summed up as the study of local properties of curves and surfaces.

By local properties we mean those properties which depend only on the behavior of the curve or surface in the neighborhood of a point. The methods which are mostly regarded adequate to solve these problems are the methods of differential calculus.

For this reason, the curves and surfaces considereed in differential geometry will be defined by functions which can be differential a certain number of times.

The other aspect is the so-called global geometry.Here one studies the influence of the local properties on the behavior of the entire curve or surface.This part will be taught in latter part of this book.
